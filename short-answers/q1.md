# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance Methods/Properties:

- Created inside the class definition without static keyword.

- Accessed and operate on individual instances (this refers to the instance).

- Accessed through instances of the class (obj.method() or obj.property).
- More specific 

Class Methods/Properties:

- Created with static keyword inside the class definition.

- Accessed and operate on the class itself (this refers to the class).

- Accessed through the class itself (Class.method() or Class.property).
Used for operations that relate to the class as a whole aka more broad / generalized.
